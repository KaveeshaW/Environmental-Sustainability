# Environmental-Sustainability
A document that was created during ThinkChicago's Idea Week that focuses on a environmental sustainability in Chicago.

Selected as one of 20 total teams to pitch our solution to judges.

Links to surveys at the end of the document.

Quality of the app and food survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9JYVNZK

Demographic survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9QB3NYY

Farmer survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9SQ2WZP

I plan on creating a web app for this once I get more experience in web backend.
